# Data-Visualization-Titanic Data--Kristy Morris for Udacity Course Data Visualization Project 6


#Summary--
Creating charts/graphs to show visually the impacts of the Titanic Disaster.  The charts/graphs will show number of survivals based on classes, age groups & sex.  In exploring the data I found that Females and Upper Class had a higher survival rate, compared to males and lower class.  I had known this already before exploring, however it proved in.  The interesting thing I found was that more survivals came from the Embarked location of Southhampton compared to the other locations.  I found that to be interesting find while exploring and with the data visualization.

#Design--Data Visualization--dimple.js
I will be using dimple.js to display the charts.

index.html--original file

index_1.html--file after feedback 1 (Abbie M.)

index_2.html--file after feedback 2 (Jason M.)

index_3.html--file after feedback 3 (Tyler M.)

Final_index.html file indicates one chart with animation of all the factors.  (Embarked, AgeRange, Sex, Pclass and Survived)

I chose to use an age range in the final storyboard type chart since the chart was more designed for dates.  I did this by updating the original data file with age ranges in groups of 10.

I decided to use 4 bar charts to display the visualizations, and incorporate one Pie Chart to show the magnitude of female vs male survival compared to the survived population.  This easily demonstrates that 68% of females survived compared to only 32% of males surviving. 


#Feedback--Titanic Charts
1) Feedback-- Abbie M.---Abbie, stated that all the colors male and female should match up and placement of charts should be side to side instead of down the page, would be easier to read that way.  To incorporate these changes--index_1.html was created.

2) Feedback--Jason M. ---Jason, stated that he doesn't know what any of the charts are about--no titles.   To incorporate these changes--index_2.html was created.

3) Feedback---Tyler M. ---Tyler, stated does not know what the numbers 1, 2, 3, mean in the Pclass, and does not know what the letters mean for Embarked.  Should be the names of the classes and the names of the cities.  To incorporate these changes---index_3.html was created after data file was also updated.
