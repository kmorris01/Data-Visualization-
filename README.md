# Data-Visualization-Titanic Data--Kristy Morris for Udacity Course Data Visualization Project 6


#Summary--
Creating charts/graphs to show visually the impacts of the Titanic Disaster.  The charts/graphs will show number of survivals based on classes, age groups & sex.

#Design--Data Visualization--dimple.js
I will be using dimple.js to display the charts.
index.html--original file
index_1.html--file after feedback 1 (Abbie M.)

#Feedback--Titanic Charts
1) Feedback-- Abbie M.---Abbie, stated that all the colors male and female should match up and placement of charts should be side to side instead of down the page, would be easier to read that way.  To incorporate these changes--index_1.html was created.
