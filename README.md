# Data-Visualization-Titanic Data--Kristy Morris for Udacity Course Data Visualization Project 6


#Summary--
Creating charts/graphs to show visually the impacts of the Titanic Disaster.  The charts/graphs will show number of survivals based on classes, age groups & sex.  Females and upper class had a higher survival rate, compared to males and lower class.

#Design--Data Visualization--dimple.js
I will be using dimple.js to display the charts.

index.html--original file

index_1.html--file after feedback 1 (Abbie M.)

index_2.html--file after feedback 2 (Jason M.)

index_3.html--file after feedback 3 (Tyler M.)


#Feedback--Titanic Charts
1) Feedback-- Abbie M.---Abbie, stated that all the colors male and female should match up and placement of charts should be side to side instead of down the page, would be easier to read that way.  To incorporate these changes--index_1.html was created.

2) Feedback--Jason M. ---Jason, stated that he doesn't know what any of the charts are about--no titles.   To incorporate these changes--index_2.html was created.

3) Feedback---Tyler M. ---Tyler, stated does not know what the numbers 1, 2, 3, mean in the Pclass, and does not know what the letters mean for Embarked.  Should be the names of the classes and the names of the cities.  To incorporate these changes---index_3.html was created after data file was also updated.
