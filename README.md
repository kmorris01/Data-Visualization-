# Data-Visualization-Titanic Data--Kristy Morris for Udacity Course Data Visualization Project 6


#Summary--
I have created charts/graphs to show visually the impacts of the Titanic Disaster.  These visualizations aim to emphasis the difference survival chance across categories, so that the viewers can compare it easily. Moreover, interactive chart (with mouse over) allows the viewers to explore the category of interest on their own.  The charts/graphs will show number of survivals based on classes, age groups & sex.  The data showed that Females and Upper Class had a higher survival rate, compared to males and lower class. According to the course content, I decided to use bar charts to display the data, however I also, selected to use a couple of pie charts to help tell the story of the magnitude of the survival rates. The interesting thing I found was that more survivals came from the Embarked location of Southhampton compared to the other locations. The female passengers also had a much higher chance of survival than the males did, and in the pie charts you can see this data displayed.  The data also showed several families were aboard the Titanic.  You will see this in the Parents/Children and Siblings/Spouse Charts.  

#Design--Data Visualization--dimple.js
I will be using dimple.js to display the charts.

Objective: The story in these visuals is how the chance of survival varies across different passenger class and between children women and men. The data I want to encode in the charts includes passenger class, gender, whether they are children, parents and/or siblings and spouses.

     *Pictures for original index files labeled original index pic 1, 2, 3

index_1.html--file after feedback 1 (Abbie M.)
     
     *Picture with file name index 1 pic and index 1 pic 2

index_2.html--file after feedback 2 (Jason M.)

    *Picture with file name index 2 pic and index 2 pic pie

index_3.html--file after feedback 3 (Tyler M.) 

    *Picture with file name index 3 pic and index 3 pic pie

Final_index.html file indicates one chart with animation of all the factors.  (Embarked, AgeRange, Sex, Pclass and Survived)
   
    *Picture with file name final index pic 

I chose to use an age range in the final storyboard type chart since the chart was more designed for dates.  I did this by updating the original data file with age ranges in groups of 10.

I decided to use 4 bar charts to display the visualizations, and incorporate one Pie Chart to show the magnitude of female vs male survival compared to the survived population.  This easily demonstrates that 68% of females survived compared to only 32% of males surviving.  I also updated the data to as shown in file titanic_data_1 to show Pclass as Lower, Middle and Upper.  And to show the Embarked city names instead of letters.  All of this was done based on feedback as displayed below.

  **I removed final_html at the suggestion of the reviewer, as index 3 html had the the charts desired.  I updated data to titanic_data_2 to correct typo of Southhampton.


#Feedback--Titanic Charts
1) Feedback-- Abbie M.---Abbie, stated that all the colors male and female should match up and placement of charts should be side to side instead of down the page, would be easier to read that way.  To incorporate these changes--index_1.html was created.

2) Feedback--Jason M. ---Jason, stated that he doesn't know what any of the charts are about--no titles.   To incorporate these changes--index_2.html was created.

3) Feedback---Tyler M. ---Tyler, stated does not know what the numbers 1, 2, 3, mean in the Pclass, and does not know what the letters mean for Embarked.  Should be the names of the classes and the names of the cities.  To incorporate these changes---index_3.html was created after data file was also updated.
